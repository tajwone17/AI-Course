## Search Algorithms

### 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**File:** `breadth_first_search.cpp`

#### How it works:

- Explores nodes level by level from the starting node
- Uses a queue (FIFO) to maintain the order of exploration
- Guarantees finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs

#### Applications:

- Finding shortest path in unweighted graphs
- Level-order traversal of trees
- Social networking (finding connections)
- Web crawling
- GPS navigation systems

#### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges
- **Space Complexity:** O(V) for the queue and visited array

#### Input & Output Example:

### 2. Depth-First Search (DFS)

**File:** `depth_first_search.cpp`

#### How it works:

- Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking

**File:** `iterative_deepening_search.cpp`

#### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(b^d) where d = depth of solution

### 6. A\* Search Algorithm

**File:** `a_star.cpp`

#### How it works:

- Combines actual cost (g) and heuristic cost (h)
- Uses f(n) = g(n) + h(n) to evaluate nodes

### 7. Bidirectional Search

**File:** `bidirectional.cpp`, `bidirectional_search_path.cpp`

#### How it works:

- Finding shortest path in large graphs
- Social network analysis (degrees of separation)
- Bioinformatics sequence alignment
- Database query optimization

### 8. Beam Search

**File:** `beam_search.cpp`

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented as a standalone C++ program. To use any algorithm:

1. Choose the appropriate algorithm file
2. Compile using a C++ compiler
3. Run with appropriate input parameters

## Compilation

To compile any of the algorithms, use:

```bash
g++ -o algorithm_name algorithm_name.cpp
