This README describes the step-by-step process of creating educational content for the AI course using AI tools, as per the assignment requirements.

## üìã Assignment Deliverables

- **Presentation Slides**: `What-I-Learned-from-the-Artificial-Intelligence-Course.pptx` (10-12 slides)
- **Course Summary Video**: `AI Course Summary Video.mp4` (1+ minute duration)
- **Google Drive Link**: [Access All Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Qnuqooarik-ilXzOi9K0TzAHnCzSHZp-?usp=drive_link)

## üìù Assignment Requirements

Create content covering the combination of:

- **Theory**: Topics learned in the AI course
- **Lab Tasks**: Algorithm implementations and AI games developed

## üéØ How I Created the Presentation Using Gamma

**Tool Used**: [Gamma](https://gamma.app/)

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Account Setup**

   - Visited the official Gamma website: https://gamma.app/
   - Created a free account by signing up with email
   - Logged into the platform

2. **Starting the Presentation**

   - Selected "Create new presentation" option
   - Chose to use AI-powered generation feature

3. **Content Input**

   - Entered the prompt: "Create a presentation about my Artificial Intelligence course"
   - Specified that the presentation should cover:
     - Theoretical concepts learned (search algorithms, game theory)
     - Practical implementations (algorithm coding, AI games)
   - Set the requirement for 10-12 slides

4. **AI Generation**

   - Gamma's AI processed the input
   - Generated the complete slide structure automatically
   - Applied professional design templates
   - Created relevant content for each slide

5. **Customization**

   - Reviewed the AI-generated content
   - Made minor edits to match course specifics
   - Added personal learning experiences
   - Adjusted design elements as needed
